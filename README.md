## Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

## Problem I Worked On

A retail company wants to understand how customers shop across demographics, product categories and channels so they can improve sales, engagement and long-term loyalty.

The main business question I focused on is:

**How can the company use customer shopping data to identify trends, improve customer engagement and optimize marketing and product strategies**

### Business Questions I Answered in SQL

In `customer_behavior_sql_queries.sql`, I wrote queries to answer specific business questions, including:

1. **Revenue by gender**  
   - Total revenue generated by male vs female customers.

2. **High-value discount users**  
   - Customers who used a discount **and** still spent more than the average purchase amount.

3. **Top-rated products**  
   - Top 5 products with the highest average review rating.

4. **Shipping type performance**  
   - Comparison of average purchase amount between **Standard** and **Express** shipping.

5. **Subscriber vs non-subscriber value**  
   - For each subscription status:
     - Number of customers  
     - Average spend  
     - Total revenue  

6. **Discount-heavy products**  
   - Top 5 products with the highest percentage of purchases where a discount was applied.

7. **Customer segmentation by loyalty**  
   - Classified customers as **New**, **Returning**, or **Loyal** based on `previous_purchases`, and counted how many fall into each segment using a CTE.

8. **Top products within each category**  
   - Used a window function (`ROW_NUMBER()`) to find the **top 3 most purchased products** in every category.

9. **Repeat buyers and subscription**  
   - For customers with more than 5 previous purchases, checked how many are subscribed vs not subscribed.

10. **Revenue by age group**  
    - Revenue contribution of each `age_group` and ranking them by total revenue.

### Power BI Dashboard

After validating the SQL queries, I connected **Power BI** directly to the SQL database and built an interactive dashboard.  
The dashboard focuses on:

- **KPIs** such as total revenue, number of orders, average purchase amount.  
- Visuals for:
  - Revenue by gender and age group  
  - Performance by subscription status and customer segment (New/Returning/Loyal)  
  - Top products/categories and discount-heavy products  
- **Slicers/filters** so users can explore the data by category, age group and other dimensions
